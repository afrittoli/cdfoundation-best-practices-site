# CD Foundation Best Practices

A key goal of the Continuous Delivery Foundation is to address challenges in
adopting continuous delivery. This best practices site is living,
community-driven knowledge source to capture and distribute the various best
practices that have been acquired over the years by our organizations.

The CD Foundation Best Practices SIG is coordinating this effort. You can learn
more about the SIG and its mission in the [Best Practices SIG project][sig]

## Contributing

We are in the process of setting up the site and will update this README when we
are ready for broad community contributions to the content.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
