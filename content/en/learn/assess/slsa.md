Software we all build and use has many dependencies, including internal
dependencies, third-party vendor software, and open source software. And each
dependency has its own chain of dependencies.

We also need to trust the software tools and infrastructure we use to
develop, build, store, and run software. And we need to trust that members of
our teams are following secure practices.

As a result, there are many places where a software supply chain can be
vulnerable to attacks.

[Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts][slsa] is a framework for assessing
and improving the security and integrity of your software supply chain. It
maps best practices as requirements for each defined level of security maturity.
