## How to use this guide

If you are new to continuous delivery practices and want to understand their
benefits and prerequisites to starting your journey, read the
[Overview](overview).

If you have some familiarity with continuous delivery, but need help figuring
out what to prioritize, read about [assessment](assess) tools to help you identify
areas to focus on.

The rest of the subsections in this guide provide information about key areas of
continuous delivery.

Some practices depend on others, while others span the entire software
lifecycle. For example, best practices for continuous integration depend on
version control. Security best practices are most effective when applied across
the entire software supply chain. Best practices also involve collaboration
across functional teams.
